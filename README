An SSH server which accepts and executes Drush commands.

The server must run as root to launch user processes with the correct
privileges.  It may run with a non-root effective UID/GID while it is not
actively launching user processes:

  $ sudo twistd --euid --uid 65534 --gid 65534 \

This configures the server with a real UID/GID of 0 but runs it with an
effective UID/GID of 65534 (a nobody user) for most operation.

The server may be kept in the foreground for testing or deployment using
something like daemontools:

    -n \

The plugin name is "pantheon-ssh", and it requires command line arguments to
specify the address of the backend authorization server, the location of a key
and certificate to use for HTTPS requests.

the location of its SSH
host key, and

    pantheon-ssh --auth-host localhost --auth-port 49753 \
        --client-key pantheonssh/test/cakey.pem --client-cert pantheonssh/test/cacert.pem \
        --listen tcp:22 \
        --host-key pantheonssh/test/id_rsa

Combining all these options, the server might be run using this full command,
assuming a working directory of the top-level of the source (so the dummy keys
can be found):

  $ sudo twistd --euid --uid 65534 --gid 65534 -n \
      pantheon-ssh \
          --auth-host auth.example.com --auth-port 443 \
          --client-key pantheonssh/test/cakey.pem --client-cert pantheonssh/test/cacert.pem \
          --listen tcp:22 \
          --host-key pantheonssh/test/id_rsa

Proper keys should be generated for real operation.
